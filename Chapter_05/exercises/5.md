# Is the following `if` statement legal?

```c
if (n >= 1 <= 10)
    printf("n is between 1 and 10\n");
```

## If so, what does it do when `n` is equal to `0`?

- The statement is syntactically legal C code, but it does not logically check if `n` is between `1` and `10`. It only checks if the result of `(n >= 1)` is less than or equal to `10`.
- Since the result of `(n >= 1)` will always be either `0` (false) or `1` (true), and both `0` and `1` are less than or equal to `10`, the condition `(n >= 1 <= 10)` will always evaluate to true regardless of the value of `n`.
