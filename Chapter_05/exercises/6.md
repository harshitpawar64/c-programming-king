# Is the following `if` statement legal?

```c
if (n == 1-10)
    printf("n is between 1 and 10\n");
```

## If so, what does it do when `n` is equal to `5`?

- The statement is syntactically legal C code, but it does not logically check if `n` is between `1` and `10`. It only checks if `n` is exactly equal to `-9`.
- If `n` is equal to `5` and since it's not equal to `-9`, `(n == 1-10)` becomes false.
