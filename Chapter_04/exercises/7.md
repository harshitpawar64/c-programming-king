# The algorithm for computing the UPC check digit ends with the following steps:

- Subtract 1 from the total.
- Compute the remainder when the adjusted total is divided by 10.
- Subtract the remainder from 9.

## It's tempting to try to simplify the algorithm by using these steps instead:

- Compute the remainder when the total is divided by 10.
- Subtract the remainder from 10.

## Why doesn't this technique work?

- The simplified method fails because it can result in a two-digit check digit (like 10) when it should be 0.
- The original algorithm's initial "subtract 1" step ensures the check digit always falls within the 0-9 range, correctly yielding 0 where appropriate.
