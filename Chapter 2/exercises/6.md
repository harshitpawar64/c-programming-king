# Why is it not a good idea for an identifier to contain more than one adjacent underscore (as in current___balance, for example)?

Using more than one adjacent underscore in an identifier is discouraged because:

- Multiple adjacent underscores make code harder to read and maintain.
- It can cause confusion and errors, especially when collaborating with others or porting code between different compilers.

It's best to use single underscores to separate words in identifiers and avoid confusion.
