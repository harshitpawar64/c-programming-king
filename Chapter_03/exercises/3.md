# For each of the following pairs of `scanf` format strings, indicate whether or not the two strings are equivalent. If they're not, show how they can be distinguished

- a) `"%d"` versus `" %d"`
- b) `"%d-%d-%d"` versus `"%d -%d -%d"`
- c) `"%f"` versus `"%f "`
- d) `"%f,%f"` versus `"%f,  %f"`

- a) **Equivalent** &mdash; Both will skip leading whitespace in the input before attempting to read an integer.
- b) **Not Equivalent** &mdash; They can be distinguished by an input of `5 - 5 - 5`.
  - `"%d-%d-%d"` expects literal hyphens with no spaces (e.g., `5-5-5`).
  - `"%d -%d -%d"` will successfully parse `5 - 5 - 5` because the spaces in the format string tell `scanf` to skip any whitespace between the number and the hyphen.
- c) **Equivalent** &mdash; The trailing space in `"%f "` simply consumes any additional whitespace after the number in the input, but it doesn't change the value read by `%f`.
- d) **Equivalent** &mdash; The `%f` conversion specifier automatically skips leading whitespace. The extra spaces after the comma in `"%f,  %f"` are redundant.
